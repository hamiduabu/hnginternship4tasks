The first thing you want to do is to set a display picture of yourself :

- *Join* channels #announcements #stage1 #help #results by clicking on them.

if you have no coding experience at all, join #stage0- FILL IN THIS SPREADSHEET

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JrhJ0RsWeolvoI4uKpZM2u2vHm4a7vOrmNUQpt2qNYw

- At any channel you enter, always check for pinned items above 

- After you must have done that, the stage 1 task is on this link

==> https://hnginternship4.slack.com/archives/CA2DJC5JB/p1523101156000008

- If you don't know what Figma is go here

==> https://hnginternship4.slack.com/archives/CA1C3U892/p1523113193000041

- Once you finish your Figma design, take a screenshot of your whole screen with the Figma GUI, submit your screenshot in #results

- Start your html/css of the design you just did.

Use Docker. Here is your guide to what docker is and how to set it up

==> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ImSA8RfeRvHwjEkF7eoswQGhsYbwmVl1d9tkYYkpyzsIf 

you use *Windows 10 or a 32bit system, try xamp or wamp*.

- When you are done and your clock is working on your local browser

- Download the desktop app *teamviewer* for either mac/windows/linux, set up the teamviewer account, get an ID and password.

- Send a message to a Mentor:verified: (Mentors are folks that have the *verified* :verified: icon beside their name, they are always here to help you at any time) with your teamviewer ID and Password

- The Mentor will mirror you laptop screen to see what you've done.

- Hopefully, If you pass the review, The Mentor will add to #stage2. There is a task there already for #stage2, so get started already! 

- At any point you're confused, always look at the stage 1 task to get cleared, DM a mentor, *read this document again* or ask for assist in #help.

- Again, *FILL IN THIS SPREADSHEET*
